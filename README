#You WILL get a build error when you finish compiling. It is ok!

#Now what you have to do to build a deb is in xcode, archive plugin.dylib and save it somewhere, then copy it into /Directory_to_Frash/Player2/build/Release-iphoneos

#Then Run in terminal ./fakeinstall

#Copy libflashplayer.so to iroot/var/mobile/frash

#Copy everything inside paste2iroot to iroot/usr/lib (You need to make the usr/lib folders)

#Copy iroot to somewhere and rename it to Frash4iOS

#Copy DEBIAN into Frash4iOS

#In DEBIAN, change the control files version to whatever you like

#check folders and remove any .DS_Store files you might find. They are your ENEMY!

#In terminal, cd to the directory where Frash4iOS is in

#sudo dpkg -b Frash4iOS

#Then you will have Frash4iOS.deb

#Notes: Make sure you are on a Admin Acount. You need to have dpkg-deb installed on your mac, which can be a pain. Google it.
